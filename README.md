## Overview
--------

LibreGet is a personal project that I, Awiones, have been working on to create a free and open-source download manager. This project aims to provide a fast, secure, and efficient downloading experience for users.

### Planned Features

* **Multi-connection technology**: Download files up to 12x faster with our advanced multi-connection technology (planned for future release).
* **Secure downloads**: Protect your downloads with real-time virus scanning, secure HTTPS downloads, and download integrity verification (currently in development).
* **Intelligent management**: Smart features that simplify and optimize your download workflow, including automatic file categorization, bandwidth throttling control, and scheduled downloads (planned for future release).
* **Cross-platform compatibility**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms (currently in development).
* **Open-source and transparent**: Our entire codebase is publicly available on GitHub, ensuring complete transparency and community-driven development.
